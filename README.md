<h1 align="center" id="title">CNN model for Medical Diagnosis</h1>

<p id="description">The following project will attempt to create a model for finding patterns into X-ray photos in order to diagnose possible disease. We will test various classification methods (including CNN) and try to extract valuable features to identify if the patient has a potential disease such as Covid-19 or pneumonia. The final app will be containerized.

The whole prodecure will apply State-Of-The-Art Image processing of Postdoctoral Researcher Xuebin Qin.</p>
