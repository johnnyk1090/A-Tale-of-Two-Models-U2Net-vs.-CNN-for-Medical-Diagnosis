<h1 align="center" id="title">U2Net & CNN model comparison for Medical Diagnosis</h1>

<p id="description">The following project will attempt to create the ideal model for finding patterns into X-ray photos in order to diagnose possible disease. We will test CNN & U2Net models (a State-Of-The-Art Image processing method of Postdoctoral Researcher Xuebin Qin) and examine which one is appropriate for deseases detection after the Dataset's preprocessing. 
Image Dataset will be used from Kaggle.</p>
